* Dotfiles
This repo contains the configuration files for my work setup. It uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to link the files
into the $HOME directory and utilizes [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][Chemacs2]] to easily switch between [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] configurations -
whether for debug or development. I strive for literate programming via Org-mode and continue to
hold out hope that [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] can work as my configuration framework.
* Installation
To facilitate linking of files from this repo to the $HOME directory, ensure =stow= is available
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt install stow
#+END_SRC

As this repo contains submodules, clone using the following command to retrieve all necessary files.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone <URL-of-dotfiles-repo> dotfiles --recursive
